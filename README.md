ControlFlow
===========

News analysis dashboard reinvented.
##I'm sorry!

Sorry you had to do all that hard work, but you had the wrong information to begin with. You were mislead and I'm sorry. Time to plug in the right paradigm.

The interface is wrong, the design is all wrong because the paradigm is wrong.
##Enter The Screen

* A Design Pattern Language for Newsreaders
* Long-Term Trends in Visual Culture
* The Control Center Paradigm
* Information Management: Structure and Retrieval

##The Problem

* Newsreading doesn't scale like you think it does.
* What is pertinent changes the more you read.
* One can only read so much, so fast. To scale up, you need proper tools.
* Again, the more you read, the clearer your perspective is. But you actually have to read it, you can't have machines reading it for you.

##NewsBursts and The Long Tail of Analysis
* Separation of Concerns: NewsBursts vs. Analytical Long Tail
* NewsBursts: Rapid newsreading, scanning, browsing, collecting news items.
* Tagging and classifying news items, always rapidly.
* Iterative: Lather, Rinse, Repeat. You consume news items rapidly, in what is hereby conceived as the "NewsBurst".
* You scan through headlines, marking articles you want to read, tagging when needed, classifying when you can.
* Part II: The Long Tail of Analysis
* Separation of Concerns: Separate system internally. This one is about going over what you did in NewsBursts.
* Here you read articles marked as To Read, keep tagging and classifying as you go. This is a slower process, more focused.

##Top-of-Mind (ToM) Concept
* Not TODO.txt, but Top-of-Mind (ToM) Sessions.

...work in progress, come back later...
