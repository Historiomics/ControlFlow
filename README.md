ControlFlow
===========

News analysis dashboard reinvented.
##I'm sorry!

Sorry you had to do all that hard work, but you had the wrong information to begin with. You were mislead and I'm sorry. Time to plug in the right paradigm.

The interface is wrong, the design is all wrong because the paradigm is wrong.
##Enter The Screen

* A Design Pattern Language for Newsreaders
* Long-Term Trends in Visual Culture
* The Control Center Paradigm
* Information Management: Structure and Retrieval

##The Problem

* Newsreading doesn't scale like you think it does.
* What is pertinent changes the more you read.
* One can only read so much, so fast. To scale up, you need proper tools.
* Again, the more you read, the clearer your perspective is. But you actually have to read it, you can't have machines reading it for you.

...work in progress, come back later...
