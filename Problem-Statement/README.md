##The Problem

* Newsreading doesn't scale like you think it does.
* What is pertinent changes the more you read.
* One can only read so much, so fast. To scale up, you need proper tools.
* Again, the more you read, the clearer your perspective is. But you actually have to read it, you can't have machines reading it for you.
