The Center
==========
* The center doesn't have to be complicated.
* It really is just a dot on the screen, a pixel.
* Ideally, the center can be 1-bit, using a 1-bit per pixel, such as in a bitmap.
* Or it can use more than 1-bit per pixel, such as in a pixmap.
* You should try to keep it as simple as possible, though, so let's say >= 1-bit for the Center.
* Controls are built around the Center, radially.
* Vectors can move tangentially across the screen, virtually or visually.
* The user experience, however, will be of things moving towards him/her or away-from them, radially, and then things passing by tangentially, more or less (for the ideal Control Center Paradigm Implementation).
