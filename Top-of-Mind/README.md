##Top-of-Mind (ToM) Concept
* Not TODO.txt, but Top-of-Mind (ToM) Sessions.
* Interactive logging, not lists.
  => What are my Top-of-Mind categories lately?
  => When can I next have a quick review?
  => Can I set a reminders to come back in a bit and force me to review them in a ReminderBurst?

###The Top-of-Mind Category (#ToM) 12:18 2014-05-15
* Simply put, I am putting forward the idea that an individual generally has a "bullet list" or "grocery list", i.e. "to-do list", even "laundry list" of items in their mind, which I call Top-of-Mind.
* That is, one continuously has say up to 5 or so items in ToM, in the form of an unordered tuple or list. This image is meant to show how that list of Top-of-Mind items might change over time.
* I wonder what I could get if I were able to visualize my mental list of to-do items, or candidates on my "short list", or my "running tabs" that I carry in my mind's eye/mental space continuously throughout every waking moment...
* What might that look like on paper? Mathematically, I say that at any given moment in time, I have an n-tuple in my head of "things-to-do" or whatnot, elements that I call Top-of-Mind, i.e. that fit into the #ToM Category. Let us call the ToM list z, with elements z1, z2, z3...zn . Elements of z always have to belong to the set of all possible things that I can have in my ToM Category, so z âˆˆ Z, the elements z1, z2, z3...zn must always belong to the set Z.
* My n-tuple can be a 3-tuple array, or a 5-tuple, up to maybe a maximum, say, of 7-tuple, but generally I have found that I function with a 1-tuple, a 2-tuple, and a 3-tuple in that order of importance. Most of the time I have a 1-tuple running tab in my mind's eye, a.k.a. I have a one-track-mind.
