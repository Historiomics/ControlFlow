Session Management
==================
* Taking Snapshots
* Sysadmin / Logging Strategies
* Monitoring of Processes
* Tracking Errors, Flaws, Design Anti-Patterns, Points of Failure
* A Newsreading Session is a whole-body experience:
    * It happens across time and space
    * It happens across application space
    * It happens across devices
    * It is not always continuous, it can be segmented/fragmented over spans of time, can be an on and off process, stopped and taken back up pseudo-randomly
    * Newsreading is not an exclusive activity, it can consist of many other operations, applications, processes, etc.
    * This means that it must be integrated into the general newsreading environment, whatever that consists of
* Newsreading is like research and research is not just sitting on a chair
    * It consists of many different activities, it is a set of activities, with distinct methodologies
    * The Newsreading Method is more than a mere activity, it is a Method, like the Scientific Method is a Method
