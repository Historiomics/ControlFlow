Session Management
==================
* Taking Snapshots
* Sysadmin / Logging Strategies
* Monitoring of Processes
* Tracking Errors, Flaws, Design Anti-Patterns, Points of Failure
* A Newsreading Session is a whole-body experience:
    * It happens across time and space
    * It happens across application space
    * It happens across devices
    * It is not always continuous, it can be segmented/fragmented over spans of time, can be an on and off process, stopped and taken back up pseudo-randomly
