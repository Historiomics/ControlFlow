Newsvendor Model
================
* Reverse-engineneering feasible regions to newsvendor model solutions
* Using zero-determinant strategy to dominate newspaper in theoretically extortionate manner
* Strategy is memoryless. Volume of supply can be controlled.
* No one factored in the risk of human beings more intelligent than programmers and their algorithms combined.
* Reverse or Inverse Price Mechanism, The Anti-Price Signal
* Control Signal can be as small as 1-bit. The price signal is ideally a 1-bit control signal.
* Formal study of cactii structures => In network setting, one need only inject a 1-bit heartbeat pattern.
* One uses controllability as safeguard mechanism => The engineers can do it themselves.
* They can control their own network using the driver nodes and cactii skeleton and so forth, as a useful adding to network analysis and monitoring.
